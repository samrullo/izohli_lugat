- write me a react app where I load a very long text as a nice series of pages that I can leaf through like reading a book.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0);
  const text = "This is a very long text..."; // the text to be displayed
  const pages = text.split(" ").reduce((allPages, word, index) => {
    const lastPage = allPages[allPages.length - 1];
    if (!lastPage || lastPage.length >= 50) {
      allPages.push([word]);
    } else {
      lastPage.push(word);
    }
    return allPages;
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
      <div>
        {pages[currentPage].join(" ")}
        {currentPage > 0 && (
          <button onClick={() => setCurrentPage(currentPage - 1)}>
            Previous Page
          </button>
        )}
        {currentPage < pages.length - 1 && (
          <button onClick={() => setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1)}>
            Next Page
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This code uses the useState hook to manage the state of the current page being displayed. The text is split into an array of pages, where each page is an array of words. The reduce function is used to create this array of pages.

The currentPage state is used to display the text for the current page, and the Previous Page and Next Page buttons are conditionally rendered based on the current page number.


- when I have a whole book to load from server it might cause a long wait time to load the whole page from the server. What do you advise in that case


When loading a large amount of data from a server, it's best to implement pagination to break the data into smaller chunks and load it incrementally. This way, the user can start using the app as soon as the first page of data has been loaded, without having to wait for the entire book to be loaded.

To implement pagination, you could modify the code I provided earlier to make an API call to the server to retrieve only the data for the current page. The server should be configured to only return the data for the requested page, and the number of items per page should be limited to a reasonable amount.

Here's an example of how you could implement pagination in your React app:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState(null);
  const [pages, setPages] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // make API call to retrieve the text for the current page
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/text?page=${currentPage}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setText(data.text);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [currentPage]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!text) return;

    // split the text into pages
    const pages = text.split(" ").reduce((allPages, word, index) => {
      const lastPage = allPages[allPages.length - 1];
      if (!lastPage || lastPage.length >= 50) {
        allPages.push([word]);
      } else {
        lastPage.push(word);
      }
      return allPages;
    }, []);

    setPages(pages);
  }, [text]);

  if (!pages) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
      <div>
        {pages[currentPage].join(" ")}
        {currentPage > 0 && (
          <button onClick={() => setCurrentPage(currentPage - 1)}>
            Previous Page
          </button>
        )}
        {currentPage < pages.length - 1 && (
          <button onClick={() => setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1)}>
            Next Page
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we're using the useEffect hook to make an API call to retrieve the text for the current page. The useEffect hook is triggered whenever the currentPage state changes, so a new API call is made each time the user switches to a different page.

We're also using a second useEffect hook to split the text into pages, just like in the previous example. This ensures that the text is split into pages only after it has been retrieved from the server.

While the user is waiting for the text to be loaded, a "Loading..." message is displayed. This provides feedback to the user and lets them know that the app is still working, even though the text has not yet been loaded.
